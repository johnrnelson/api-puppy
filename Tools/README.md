# Tools and Utilities
Use these helpful scripts on the server or desktop. 

Add more tools and document them here. :-)

Only use utilitiy scripts for the server or project. It's not for the consumer! 

## Bash Scripts
`HardPull.sh` is used when the files on the server get modifed and they get out of synce with git. :-)

`RefreshServer.sh` will pull down the latest code from github and restart the PM2 services.

Add what you think is helpful for the server or the project. Linters and whatnot might be a good idea.
