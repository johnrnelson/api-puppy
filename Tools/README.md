# Tools and Utilities
Use these helpful scripts on the server or desktop. 

Add more tools and document them here. :-)

Only use utilitiy scripts for the server or project. It's not for the consumer! 

# Debugging Tools
Visual Studio Code is a great tool to use to debug nodejs but you can 
use whatever debugger you want. Create the runners you need in your 
own tool to get you to a point you can step through and edit as needed.
