An important note is the short list of vendor modules and libraries. It's easy 
to slap on another NPM but before you do, please consider it. Lets keep 
this project as clean and close to the metal as possible. 



# Clone The Project
Make sure you setup your SSH correctly!

    git clone git@github.com:johnrnelson/api-puppy


 

## TODO
This is quick running to do list of items that should be moved to the github issues list. 
However it would seem as only the people actually using the code are the ones doing the 
todo list. :-)

- [x] Support multiple tasks per request  
- [ ] Live documentation and tools
- [ ] Support paths and query string for routing
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) fixes!
 

CORB
Guess there is work to be done to fix this...


    CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

Another day...
For now remove it since it causes errors..
