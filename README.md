## FAQ
**Is this yet another framework or library?**

NO! Absolutly not no please no not another framework or library!

**Why not just use express and other 3rd party middleware?**

Why should I? Because it's easier? I think not. :smiley:

**Your code looks like spaghetti cooked by a chaotic evil apprentice/newbie!**

Yeah I'm just having fun here and trying to reach the lowest level of user.
But feel free to fork, clone, or peel off what ya want and do a better job. I'd 
love to see other peoples ideas of improvement. 

**Why use the name "api-puppy"?**

I wanted to choose a name that nobody could hate. I feel like tech these days use 
marketing way too much but I can't beat them so I join them. A cheap jedi mind 
trick to ensure that the name will most likely be at least liked if not loved and 
who does not love a puppy?


## TODO
This is quick running to do list of items that should be moved to the github issues list.

todo list. :-)
