This is most likely **NOT** what you think it is. :thinking:

The live server has been shut off. :-(


## Quick Install Instructions
Clone the project to a new folder.

    git clone git@github.com:johnrnelson/api-puppy.git
    cd api-puppy

Install the NPM(s). Check the `package.json` file. :smiley:

    npm update

Now run the SETUP if this is your first time.

    node ./SETUP.js
 
You are ready to run the API Server. 

    node RunWebServer.js

The console will give you the port number or the default is 
[Local Host](http://localhost:9080) or whatever you set it to in the 
`CONFIG.json` file in the `SECRET` folder.
