## Q&A
**Why not just use express and other 3rd party middleware?**

Why should I? Because it's easier? I think not. :smiley:

**Your code looks like spaghetti cooked by a chaotic evil apprentice/newbiew!**

Yeah I'm just having fun here and trying to reach the lowest level of user.
But feel free to fork, clone, or peel off what ya want and do a better job. I'd 
love to see other peoples ideas of improvement. 



## TODO
This is quick running to do list of items that should be moved to the github issues list. 
However it would seem as only the people actually using the code are the ones doing the 
todo list. :-)

- [x] Support multiple tasks per request  
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP) fixes!
- [x] Support paths and query string for routing
- [ ] Live documentation and tools
