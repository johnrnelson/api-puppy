#### Project Goals
Why does this project exist? 

- [x] Proof of concepts  
- [x] Learn about technology fundamentals
- [x] Have a lot of fun!
- [ ] Refactor the code to please the puritist?

## Q&A
**Is this yet another framework or library?**

NO!

**Why not just use express and other 3rd party middleware?**

Why should I? Because it's easier? I think not. :smiley:

**Your code looks like spaghetti cooked by a chaotic evil apprentice/newbiew!**

Yeah I'm just having fun here and trying to reach the lowest level of user.
But feel free to fork, clone, or peel off what ya want and do a better job. I'd 
love to see other peoples ideas of improvement. 

**Why use the name "api-puppy"?**

I wanted to choose a name that nobody could hate. I feel like tech these days use 
marketing way too much but I can't beat them so I join them. A cheap jedi mind 
trick to ensure that the name will most likely be at least liked if not loved and 
who does not love a puppy?



## TODO
This is quick running to do list of items that should be moved to the github issues list. 
However it would seem as only the people actually using the code are the ones doing the 
todo list. :-)

- [x] Support multiple tasks per request  
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP) fixes!
- [x] Support paths and query string for routing
- [ ] Live documentation and tools
