# NPM 
We use this for the package manager. Check out the 
`package.json` file in the root of this project to 
see the complete list of packages used.



An important note is the short list of vendor modules and libraries. It's easy 
to slap on another NPM but before you do, please consider it. Lets keep 
this project as clean and close to the metal as possible.
