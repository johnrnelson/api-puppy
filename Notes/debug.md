# Debuging

The debug UI should help the user expore the UI, get documentation for it, and 
actually use it for debugging purposes. 

To debug the actual API source code, just clone the project and use `npm update` 
to ensure the packages get installed.  

# Debugging Tools
Visual Studio Code is a great tool to use to debug nodejs but you can 
use whatever debugger you want. Create the runners you need in your 
own tool to get you to a point you can step through and edit as needed.
