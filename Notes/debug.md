# Debuging

Wow this is a big topic. Can someone help us with this?

The debug UI should help the user expore the UI, get documentation for it, and 
actually use it for debugging purposes. 


# Local Host
If you setup SSH correctly, or are using your own backend web server, you can 
quickly go to http://127.0.0.1:9118/ and get the full debug UI.
