# API Server
This provides the API and it's HTML UI for the debug helper.

Use `APIServer/debug/API_HELP.json` file to edit the list of services for the HTML client.

[View Source](debug/API_HELP.json) to see what the demo server is using.  

## Running
Go to the `APIServer` folder and run the `APIServer.js` script. 

     ./APIServer.js

or

    node APIServer.js



Use PM2 or something like that on a production server. :-)
