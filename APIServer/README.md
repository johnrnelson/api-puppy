# API Server
This provides the API functions and it's HTML UI for the debug helper.

ServiceLogger just addes JSON to a flat file.

ServiceManager ties in all the services using JSON. 

SocketManager holds the code to manage the socket.

StaticFileServer will just read files from the docs folder and spit it back out.
