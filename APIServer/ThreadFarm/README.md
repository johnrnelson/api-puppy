# Threading in Node
Not sure yet if we need to use threading. 

Use the files here to learn and test how
to use threads.

If threading is actually needed, use a mature
open source library rather than rolling your
own even if you know what you are doing. 
Threading can cause a lot of unexpected 
problems so stick to something that has a lot
of support.
